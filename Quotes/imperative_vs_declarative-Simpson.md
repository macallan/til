# Imperative vs. Declarative

In chapter 4 of [Functional Light JS](https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS/blob/master/manuscript/ch4.md/#chapter-4-composing-functions) by Kyle Simpson, he explains the difference between imperative and declarative programming. 

```
Imperative code is primarily concerned with explicitly stating how to accomplish a task. Declarative code states what the outcome should be, and leaves the implementation to some other responsibility.

Declarative code abstracts the what from the how. Typically declarative coding is favored in readability over imperative, though no program (except of course machine code 1s and 0s) is ever entirely one or the other. The programmer must seek balance between them.
```

Kyle points out something important here that I have never thought about before. Separating the what from the how makes code more readable.
